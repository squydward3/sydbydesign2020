This sufficed for a while since as a young startup, we primarily catered to smaller companies (20–50 employees) with less complicated organizational structure.</p><p>To create a subsidiary, companies had to sign up for a entirely new account. There was virtually no in-app connection between these closely related account instances. Users had to log out of their current org in order to log in to another subsidiary. This approach soon became insufficient as we gained bigger clients with clearly defined legal entities within. Their users, especially admins, <span class="bold">need a centralized platform </span> to easily switch among entities.</p></div></div></div><section class="process"><div class="container"><div class="row"><h3 class="col-sm-3">Research</h3><div class="col-sm-6"><p>As highly demanded as the feature was,  we knew that we couldn’t start roadmapping just yet. Other than account management, there were too many undefined moving pieces associated with this project:  corporate cards, receipt management, etc. Building this feature would affect various parts of our data model and in-app workflows.</p><p>We felt that we needed further research on  our clients’ company structure, admin/employee habits, supportable use cases, etc. in order to build a sustainable feature that would strengthen Abacus’s core. Working with the customer success team, we sent out a survey to 100 clients, hoping that their responses would inform our decisions in scoping in this project.</p></div></div><div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-10"><img class="full" src="assets/img/connected-org-survey-questions.png"/><img class="full" src="assets/img/connected-org-survey-results.png"/></div><div class="col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-6"><p><span class="bold">Among what we found</span>:</p><ul class="bullet-list"><li class="flex jc-sb"><span class="count">1.</span><span>Admins are more likely to switch orgs than employees.</span></li><li class="flex jc-sb"><span class="count">2.</span><span>The top 3 use cases for this feature are blank split, accounting integration split, and data sandboxing.</span></li></ul></div></div></section><section class="process"><div class="container"><div class="row"><h3 class="col-sm-3">Scope</h3><div class="col-sm-6"><p>Informed by our survey responses, we finally laid down some ground work for the feature.

Existing users will have to briefly be onboarded to their second org. They will also have to go through a “disambiguation” screen to decide which org they’re  logging into.  My first task was to redesign the onboarding flow on web & mobile in a Connected Orgs world. This allowed us to see <span class="bold">which parts</span> of our user entry flow would <span class="bold">require an extra disambiguation step</span>.</p></div><div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-10"><img class="full" src="assets/img/connected-org-desktop-flow.png"/></div><p class="col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-6 bigger blockquote">My first task was to redesign the onboarding flow on web & mobile in a Connected Orgs world</p><div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-10"> <img class="full" src="assets/img/connected-org-mobile-flow.png"/><img class="full" src="assets/img/onboarding_task_analysis.png"/></div></div></section></section><section class="process"><div class="container"><div class="row"><h3 class="col-sm-3">Disambiguation          </h3><p class="col-sm-6">Org disambiguation is the heart and soul of this project.
