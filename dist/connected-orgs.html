That sufficed for a while since as a young startup, we were primarily working with smaller companies (20-50 employees) with less complicated organizational structure.</p><p>To create another branch, companies had to use a hack by creating a brand new Abacus account then naming that account differently. For example, MailChimp used to have 2 accounts: MailChimp - SF and MailChimp - NY. This hacky approach soon proved insufficient as we gained larger clients with clearly defined legal entities within.</p></div></div></div><section class="process"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-3"><h3>Research</h3></div><div class="col-sm-6"><p>As highly demanded as the feature was,  we knew that we couldn’t start roadmapping just yet. Other than account management, there were too many undefined moving pieces associated with this project:  corporate cards, receipt management, etc. Building this feature would affect various parts of our data model and in-app workflows.</p><p>We felt that we needed further research on  our clients’ company structure, admin/employee habits, supportable use cases, etc. in order to build a sustainable feature that would strengthen Abacus’s core. Working with the customer success team, we sent out a survey to 100 clients, hoping that their responses would inform our decisions in scoping in this project.</p></div></div><img class="full" src="assets/img/connected-orgs-survey-questions.png"/></div></section><section class="process"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-3"><h3>Scope</h3></div><div class="col-sm-6"><p>Informed by our survey responses, we finally laid down some ground work for the feature. I worked mainly on the account management part of the feature, which covers 3 main flows:</p><ul class="bullet-list"><li class="flex jc-sb"><span class="count">1.</span><span>Users should be able to select which org to go to both at login and in app, on both web and mobile. We call this process disambiguation.</span></li><li class="flex jc-sb"><span class="count">2.</span><span>Admins should be able to create a subsidiary for their organization.</span></li><li class="flex jc-sb"> <span class="count">3.</span><span>Admins should be able to invite employees to new subsidiary</span></li></ul></div></div></div></section><section class="process"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-3"><h3>Onboarding</h3></div><div class="col-sm-6"><p>The onboarding flow is arguably the most disrupted process with Connected Orgs. Existing users will have to briefly be onboarded to their second org. They will also have to go through a “disambiguation” screen to decide which org they’re  logging into.  My first task was to redesign the onboarding flow on web & mobile in a Connected Orgs world. This allowed us to see which parts of our user entry flow would require an extra disambiguation step.</p></div></div><img class="full" src="assets/img/abacus_onboarding_desktop_flow.png"/><img class="full" src="assets/img/abacus_onboarding_mobile_flow.png"/><img class="full" src="assets/img/onboarding_task_analysis.png"/></div></section></section><section class="process"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-3"><h3>Disambiguation</h3></div><div class="col-sm-6"><p>Org disambiguation is the heart and soul of this project.
