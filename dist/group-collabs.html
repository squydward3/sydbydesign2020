If you own an online business, you can browse, favorite, and request a “collab” such as an Instagram giveaway with other e-commerce brands.</p><p>After 3 months, we reached 2000 profile created. However, active users—those who have taken such actions as favorite another brand or request a collab within the past 30 days—only account for roughly ⅓ of total users. Our goal is to bring this number up.</p></div></div></div><section class="process"><div class="container"><div class="row"><h3 class="col-sm-3">Problem & Research</h3><div class="col-sm-6"> <p>For the past few months, we have been conducting weekly user interviews with e-commerce business owners; some were Collab users, some were our managed partners. We also studied event funnels and watched users’ sessions on Collabs using FullStory.</p></div></div><div class="col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-6"><img class="full" src="assets/img/group-collabs/fullstory.png"/></div><div class="col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-6"><p>Based on frequent communication with our users, we had a couple of theories on why users didn’t remain active on Collabs:</p><ul class="bullet-list"><li class="flex jc_sb ai_baseline"><span class="bullet"><div></div></span><span>Users <span class="bold">did not fully understand</span> the idea of a “collab” and were <span class="bold">nervous about clicking the “Request a Collab” button</span>. Is it going to send the other brand a n invite or message? What does a collab look like? How does this benefit my business? Information about Collabs and how it works was scant since it was a new platform.</span></li><li class="flex jc_sb ai_baseline"><span class="bullet"><div></div></span><span>Users who sent out collab requests were <span class="bold">discouraged by others’ unresponsiveness</span>. Because they could only send out 1on1 requests, they felt as if they were shooting the dark. The 1on1 method, which was supposed to give “shy” users ample room to explore, was starting to be proven inefficient and ineffective.</span></li><li class="flex jc_sb ai_baseline"><span class="bullet"><div></div></span><span>Users find that setting up a collab is a demanding process. They want an easier <span class="bold">entry point</span> which also allows more collaborators to join and broaden the collab’s audience reach.</span></li><li class="flex jc_sb ai_baseline"><span class="bullet"><div></div></span><span>Users wanted <span class="bold">explore other collab options</span> besides Instagram Giveaway, which is a type of collab that we funneled users straight into when they signed up.</span></li></ul></div></div></section></section></body><section class="process"><div class="container"><div class="row"><h3 class="col-sm-3">Hypothesis</h3><div class="col-sm-6"> <p>By inverting the 1on1 collab experience so that users can browse ongoing collabs in addition to brands, users will be able to <span class="bold">see how a collab works first </span> without having to commit to one.

Starting out, I want the cards to be long with clear “Request to join” CTA so that they could carry plenty of information. I also wanted them to look distinct from the brand cards. However, after studying how our users interact with the current brand cards and going through these designs with the team, we decided that the cards should be more visually interesting than wordy, since most uses will click on them and go to the collab detail page anyways.</p></div><div class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8"><img class="full" src="assets/img/group-collabs/card-design-iterations.png"/></div><div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-9"><div class="vid full"><video loop="" autoplay=""><source src="assets/img/group-collabs/browse-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4"/><Your>browser does not support the video tag.</Your></video></div></div><div class="col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-6"><h5>Host a Collab</h5><p>When designing this flow, I speculate that hosts won’t receive a lot of requests to join to start with.

It made me think about things that don’t happen on the immediate product UI such as email notifications and email entry points, things that get triggered by an action such as counters, labels, and their various states. Most importantly, it made me realize the value of workflow gamification in encouraging users to complete tasks.</p></div></div></section><footer id="footer"><div class="container"><div class="links"><a href="index.html">Home</a><a href="monthly-recap.html">Monthly Recap</a><a href="policy-redesign.html">Policy Redesign</a><a href="group-collabs.html">Group Collabs</a><a href="export-builder.html">Export Builder</a><a href="connected-orgs.html">Connected Orgs</a><a href="agency.html">Agency(Havas)</a><a href="highcut.html">HighCUT</a></div><p class="copyright">© 2019 Sydney Mai.
