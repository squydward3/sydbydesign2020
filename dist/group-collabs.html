If you own an online business, you can browse, favorite, and request a “collab” such as an Instagram giveaway with other e-commerce brands.</p><p>After 3 months, we reached 2000 profile created. However, active users—those who have taken such actions as favorite another brand or request a collab within the past 30 days—only account for roughly ⅓ of total users. Our goal is to bring this number up.</p></div></div></div><section class="process"><div class="container"><div class="row"><h3 class="col-sm-3">Problem & Research</h3><div class="col-sm-6"> <p>For the past few months, we have been conducting weekly user interviews with e-commerce business owners; some were Collab users, some were our managed partners.

Starting out, I want the cards to be long with clear “Request to join” CTA so that they could carry plenty of information. I also wanted them to look distinct from the brand cards. However, after studying how our users interact with the current brand cards and going through these designs with the team, we decided that the cards should be more visually interesting than wordy, since most uses will click on them and go to the collab detail page anyways.</p></div><div class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-8"><img class="full" src="assets/img/group-collabs/card-design-iterations.png"/></div><div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-10"><div class="vid full"><video loop="" autoplay=""><source src="assets/img/group-collabs/browse-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4"/><Your>browser does not support the video tag.</Your></video></div></div><div class="col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-6"><h5>Host a Collab</h5><p>When designing this flow, I speculate that hosts won’t receive a lot of requests to join to start with.

It made me think about things that don’t happen on the immediate product UI such as email notifications and email entry points, things that get triggered by an action such as counters, labels, and their various states. Most importantly, it made me realize the value of workflow gamification in encouraging users to complete tasks.</p></div></div></section><footer id="footer"><div class="container"><div class="links"><a href="/">Home</a><a href="monthly-recap">Monthly Recap</a><a href="policy-redesign">Policy Redesign</a><a href="group-collabs">Group Collabs</a><a href="export-builder">Export Builder</a><a href="design-at-abacus">Design at Abacus</a><a href="connected-orgs">Connected Orgs</a><a href="design-at-selfmade">Design at SelfMade</a><a href="agency">Agency (Havas)</a><a href="highcut">HighCUT</a></div><p class="copyright">© 2020 Sydney Mai.
