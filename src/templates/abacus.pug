        h3 EXPENSE POLICY
        p.padding-tb18 The Expense Policy page is where companies set up rules to pre-screen expense submissions. While it was one of the most important parts of the product, this page was also the oldest and had the most heinous usability issues. I embarked on a 6-week long project to redesign this core platform experience for Abacus.

        p.padding-tb18 By designing a custom CSV export that allows admins to export the exact data they want in the format they need, I help Abacus support integrations with any accounting software and allow admins to mobilize expense data for tracking, reporting, and analysis.

          h3 TRAVEL
          p.padding-top18 Abacus’s parent company acquired a corporate travel-booking platform in 2019. We consequently inherited travel data objects such as receipts and itineraries from this standalone product. I was tasked with designing how to display these objects natively in Abacus.

        p.padding-top18 Aside from designing the Abacus experience on the web, I also spent some time working on the mobile app. While the web app is primarily for admins to review and approve expenses, the mobile app helps employees quickly submit expenses on the go.

        p.padding-top18 Admins needed a way to efficiently replace hundreds of employees’ records on Abacus. I designed a workflow that allowed them to upload their HRIS export to Abacus and bulk update users’ profiles.
