              p The Expense Policy page is where companies set up rules to pre-screen expense submissions. While it was one of the most important parts of the product, this page was also the oldest and had the most heinous usability issues. I embarked on a 6-week long project to redesign this core platform experience for Abacus.

            p In recent years, we observe that backers tend to “overpledge” (pledge for an amount higher than the minimum asked) for rewards on Kickstarter. Overpledge accounted for 4.1% of Kickstarter’s revenue in 2019, approximately $1.2M.
          .col-md-5.col-sm-12
            p Much of this overpledge behavior could be attributed to add-ons – optional mini-rewards that backers can choose to add to their main rewards.

            p Despite much friction, this unsupported, user-generated functionality continued to prevail on our site. A quick browse through most campaign descriptions, you’ll find extensive information about available add-ons, accompanied by big add-on graphics. 
          .col-md-5.col-sm-12
            p Creators then ask backers to add $X to their pledges for add-on A, $Y for add-on B. #[span(class="bold") Backers had to do the math themselves], and #[span(class="bold") creators had to sort out what add-ons to ship based on the additional amount]. Needless to say, both checkout and fulfillment were a nightmare.

            p Productizing add-ons would touch many parts of the 10-year-old platform, from project build to checkout, creator dashboard to transactional emails. Our feature team, Creator Tools, had a multi-phased approach to developing the feature, starting with the highest-priorities, #[span(class="bold") Checkout] and #[span(class="bold") Project Build]. 
          .col-md-5.col-sm-12
            p I was brought on board while the development of checkout with add-ons was in flux. For the next few months, I would be the sole designer for all checkout edge cases, secondary UIs, transaction emails, and most importantly, the #[span(class="bold") add-on creation flow for creators].

            p Creators need a way to build and manage add-ons. Traditionally, reward building has been done in Project Build, the de-facto campaign-building part of Kickstarter. We historically had only supported 2 reward-type objects: reward and items. Add-on would be the 3rd addition to this product surface.
            p.padding-top18 Before architecting this experience, I wanted to gain a full understanding of the current UI scope. What’s the average/min/max number of rewards per launched project, sliced by categories and funding tiers? How many items does each reward have on average/at min/at max? What percentage of projects itemize their rewards? 
          .col-md-5.col-sm-12
            p I want to design an experience that is resilient to errors and edge cases, that serves the 80% case just as well as the 20% case. For a feature that deals with lots of numerical data, this is a core UX principle.

            p With this feature, I placed great emphasis on rapid testing and iterations. From late April to mid-June 2020, I did a total of 3 rounds of testing and design iterations, walking through the feature with 10 creators from various funding tiers and categories, from under $5K to over $100K, games to publishing, independent to big-named creators.
          .col-md-5.col-sm-12
            p Through rapid testing, we were able to:
            +bullets(
          "Validate creators’ desire to custom assign add-ons to rewards, which was originally scoped out",
          "Uncover creators’ perception of add-ons as singular items, not entire rewards"
        )

            img(src="assets/img/kickstarter/add-on-assign.gif").full
            p I worked on various interaction models for custom add-on assignment (in modals, within main reward management UI, etc.) After 3 rounds of user walkthroughs, I settled on incorporating the interaction in the add/edit flow, as it caused the least friction.

            p The cell design went through many iterations. I made extensive use of iconography for edit actions and created a system for color-coded pills. The cells also had gone through a bunch of accessibility and UI pressure tests.

            p Seeping through survey feedback, we notice that many backers, especially experienced backers, were confused as to where during checkout add-ons would be presented. I designed these “add-on available” pills as a quick fix to this issue.
          .col-md-5.col-sm-12 
            p.padding-top18 Although we might eventually want to incorporate add-ons into the project page, we want to see if this easy fix reduces the number of immediate concerns first.

            p Another high-impact, low-lift UX improvement was the tab redesign. We noticed that creators were having trouble discovering the new add-on tab due to low interactivity.I originally repurposed an old Kickstarter tab pattern, but since it proved to hinder discoverability, I decided to redesign the entire tab navigation area on this page.
